I learned to git push and git pull
I have learned about git commit -m, using git add "filename" before it


## Startup
  - I have completed my startup and inventory system, I have even listed hypothetical success at the end of the semester with the program, I am working towards **IF** scenario is completely successful
  - I am having a hard time keeping up with everything since we haven't really starting typing languages yet, but I am doing my best to understand the assignments given
## HTML Structure assignment
  - I was able to change the address and add some elements to the website that was put together
  - I added an icon, my respository, and the unique websites asked for
## Other HTML Assignments
  - With what I had, I mostly just updated the given code with the objects I wanted there whether it was videos, colors, audio, pictures, and so on.
## Simon-HTML Assignment startup
  - I am looking through the info and the video, I am a bit confused on what we submit for this 100 pts, going to talk to the TA's and other class members
      - Question--- Do I make adjustments to Simon for my own domain and such or am I creating the begins and prototype of my inventory system?
  - Got my questions answered, it looks like we are setting up the basic elements of our project, I am way behind in that case, I don't know how I am going to finish this tonight
